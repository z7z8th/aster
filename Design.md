# Introduction #

The difference between TestRunner and CTS is that TestRunner uses computer vision technology combined with additional information from Android framework to emulate the operations of humans.

TestRunner has two modules: the interpreter and user interface. The user interface should allow engineers to create and run test cases.

A test case consists of operations and assertions.
